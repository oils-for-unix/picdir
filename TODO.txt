- Respect upload password
  - copy htpasswd script from panwiki I think

- Add stats about /resized/ and /upload/ dirs

- BACKUP BOTH /upload/ and /resized/
  - or should there be a way to pin it?
  - i.e. garbage collect unused ones in /resized/?
  - I think don't worry about it for now, disk space is cheap
  - back up to another host?  Or use dreamhost as backup?
    - try a2hosting?

- write integration tests with curl

- index.php router
  - checks file in current dir
  - https://www.taniarascia.com/the-simplest-php-router/
    - but we have to be careful not to mess with .css files, etc.
    - Just do stuff with no extensions

- Don't expose every file
  lib/
    functions.php -- rename config.php
    header.php
    footer.php
    meh not sure how much this matters either?

- README.md: Link to JS drag and drop blog post -- not going to do this though.
