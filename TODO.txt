- publish on Github
  - link to it
- Add some text:
  - "resizes and serves your images"
  - slogans
    - "resizes and serves your images"
  - "Redirects to a static file"
  - "Return to home page"

- Deletion?  Would require a password.

- Add stats about /resized/ and /upload/ dirs

- BACKUP BOTH /upload/ and /resized/
  - or should there be a way to pin it?
  - i.e. garbage collect unused ones in /resized/?
  - I think don't worry about it for now, disk space is cheap
  - back up to another host?  Or use dreamhost as backup?
    - try a2hosting?

- write integration tests with curl

- Don't expose every file
  - no: lib.php, lib_test.php, hash_password.php
  - yes: index.php, upload.php resize.php
