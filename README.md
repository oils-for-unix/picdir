picdir
======

A small program that receives upload images and allows resizing at serving time.

## Files

- `upload.php`: Upload an image and store it with a unique filename.
  - need optional password
- `resize.php`: Request a resized version of an image.

## Ideas

- `fetch.php`: Fetch image with curl?
- `recent.php`: List recent images
- Configure Dreamhost send mails from picdir@oilshell.org to this script too?
  - Will it respond with a URL?
  - Or maybe you can view "recently mailed"?
- Create a gallery?  What if you e-mail many pictures?
- JavaScript drag and drop
  - What about multiple images?
